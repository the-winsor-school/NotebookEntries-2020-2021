1/9/2021,"Group discussion about general engineering notebook layout
Sub-team + individual portfolio writing","At the start of the meeting, the team gathered to discuss components
of our engineering notebook. First, we presented the different layout 
options created by our business team to the rest of our team members. 
Different layout options included separating entries by subteam and 
sections labeled focus and challenges. Following, we separated into 
different breakout rooms to discuss our preffered layout. We also choose
the cover for our engineering notebook. Following notebook discussion, 
we moved onto individual and subteam writing for the engineering 
portfolio. ","I think overall, the decisions from various breakout rooms were in 
unison. We were all able to come to an agreement on one of our 
layout options. ","In terms of next steps, there is a lot of porfolio writing that needs to be 
done. I think we did a good job of brainstorming topics we want to discuss
within our different subteams. ","Audrey C., Bonnie, Maya, Amelia, Karina, Marcus, Alyssa, Abby G., Audrey W., Sophia, Abby B., Hannah, Liza, Karla, Ellie",
1/16/2021,Joint team strategy discussion,"Today, we focused on discussing a strategy for our team. We broke it up 
into two different sections short-tem focuses for our upcoming scrimmage
and also long-run goals that we hope to achieve. We broke up into breakout
rooms to discuss potential strategies and reconvened afterwards to come to 
an agreement on what our priorities should be. At the end, we also came up 
with a more specific plan of things we wanted to do during our next meeting, 
the meeting before our very first scrimmage","I think it was a little difficult to talk about strategy in the long-run 
given the current circumstances of our robot. It's definitely hard to 
predict what our robot will be like in the future, but given the time 
that we've spent on our robot, we adjusted our strategy according 
to factors that we've already been working hard on.","In terms of next steps, I think it's important for new members especially
to obtain a real qualifier or scrimmage feeling from the scrimmage that is 
coming up in two weeks. And we should continue to work on portfolio writing.","Karla, Audrey C., Marcus, Bonnie, Ava, Anie, Alyssa, Maya, Amelia, Audrey W., Ellie, Liza, Sophia",
