9/26/2020,Brainstorming wobble goal ideas and also assessing strategic possibilities,We came up with new ideas for how to move the wobble goal. We also tried to sort out the pros and cons of flywheel intake and pushing the wobble goal,"As a virtual group, it was hard to get a sense of what the pieces are actually like (friction, weight, etc.).",We should come up with a more solidified direction for prototyping and building these intake/launch and wobble goal mechs!,"Annie, Marcus, Alicia, Yuyuan, Ava",
9/26/2020,Brainstorming and assessing possible wobble goal ideas.,"We came up with various ideas on how to pick up and move the wobble goal. Then, we found the pros and cons of picking up and placing rings with a pinching mechanism as well as moving/lifting the wobble goal from the bottom.",We struggled with getting a consistent amount of how many rings would fall off a wobble goal when you dropped it over the imaginary wall. We eventually overcame this by testing multiple times and taking an average that seemed safe.,Next time we should probably vote on a final idea and start prototyping it.,"Bonnie, Haley, Karla, Ellie, Abby G",
9/26/2020,Brainstorming and assessing the pros and cons with wobble ideas and strategy,Today we came up with some ideas for the wobble goal and brainstormed how to pick up rings and place them in the low goal,"Today we struggled to see which design criteria are most important, I.e. one idea we discussed was really reliable and cost effective but it wasn't very robust or controllable so we are yet to decide which are more important","Next time, we would like to have some more concrete ideas about this mechanism and decide on one design that we would like to move forward with. Maybe we could also start prototyping.","Liza, Audrey C, Sophia",
9/26/2020,Brainstorming and assessing the pros and cons with wobble ideas and strategies,We discussed different mechs for grabbing and pushing the wobble goal as well as placing it in the drop zone.,It was difficult to explain ideas. It was also difficult to draw and write our ideas while social distancing. It was hard to accurately assess ideas without any data or prototypes.,We should work more on ideas for combining different mechs and prototyping.,"Alyssa, Audrey C, Jolie, Maya",
9/26/2020,Brainstorming pros/cons in order to figure out strategy for continuous intake + push mech,"Focused on brainstorming mechs for the wobble goal, and then in our group we brainstormed strategies for continuous launcher intake method in addition to the pushing wobble method","Figuring out how feasible the two mechs are when they are combined in terms of taking up space, a solution was just using simple push mech and the launcher instead of clamp.","Maybe work out ideas for combining the two mechs, and start testing out ideas.","Amelia, Kayla, Ali",
10/3/2020,Prototyping with legos and voting on final mechs.,Each individual person got a certain mech idea from our brainstorming last meeting to prototype with legos. We then shared our prototypes with the rest of the team. Then the entire team voted on one set of mechs we thought would work best.,We realized that legos are limited in what we can do with them and we overcame that by understanding that they were not perfect and that we would need to explain certain aspects.,We started prototyping with real robot parts.,"Amelia, Alyssa, Hannah, Abby G, Ellie,  Jolie",
10/3/2020,Prototyping final mechs with robotic parts.,"We broke up into 2 pairs to work on the launching and intake mechs. One group worked on building the launcher mech. We took measurements such as the diameter of the wheel and ring to help us make the border and platform. The other group worked on the intake system, which is a drill/motor-based mech with a wheel in the center. We attached a wheel on a drill with a base of cardboard to simulate a flat surface.","There wasn't a flat surface for the drill, so it was not very stable.",Continue to prototype with real robot parts.,"Amelia, Alyssa, Hannah, Abby G",
10/3/2020 (afternoon),CADing prototypes/ CADing for prototypes,"We attempted to download part files in order to CAD prototypes, but we gave up and decided to just CAD parts for a prototype. We focused on the launcher diagram that the morning group worked on.","We had a lot of issues trying to upload STEP files into Fusion 360, We also tried converting to STL first but that didn't seem to work",Laser cut the files we made last time and assemble launch prototype.,"Maya, Karina",
10/10/2020,Prototyping launch mechanism,"Today we made a prototype of the launch mech first using the laser-cut notches. The notches made the radius a little too small, so we tried again by using hot glue instead of the notches. This wider radius worked 
well.","The radius of the half-circle mechanism was too small, since the upper and lower pieces were designed to have edges of the right radius but the connecting notches were put on the inside of the edge. This made the launch less powerful and the ring did not go as far. There was also some trouble getting the hot glue to stay.",Laser cut and Test out a new CADed design of the launch prototype with a wider radius.,"Ellie, Jolie, Maya",
10/10/2020,Prototyping Horizontal Intake Mech,"We used a couple flats, lego wheels, and a drill to create a horizontal intake prototype. We used two rows of two wheels each. The ring would essentially be taken in from below the wheels.","The wheels were a bit too small, so they got caught in the middle of the ring. The flat was also at an awkward height which prevented the wheels from properly catching the ring. We also had a bit of trouble stabilizing the wheels/axles.",We are planning to further stabilize the wheels and put them on more of an angle so they in the future could bring rings up and into the launch mech.,"Hannah, Alyssa",
10/10/2020,Go Builda Chassis Assembly,We began assembling our second Go Builda Chassis in order for the builders to work with one and the coders to use the other one for coding autonomous.,"We had assembled one piece incorrectly in the beginning which caused aligning and symmetry issues, but we realized our error and fixed it quickly.",We just finished assembling step 8,"Annie, Amelia",
10/10/2020 (afternoon),Go Builda Chassis Assembly + throwing mechanism prototype assembly,I picked up where those who worked on the chassis this morning had left off and finished putting it together. I then worked with Zoe to assemble a working prototype of our throwing mechanism,"We found that the sides of our throwing mech would perform better if we attached them to the base with holes rather than slots, so that we can create more tension/friction.",Design and print a prototype with holes instead of indents so there is more tension,"Jordyn, Zoe",
10/17/2020,Building horizontal intake mech,"We began building the intake mech by cutting metal t-slotted aluminum to attach the mech to. We tested three prototypes of 3D printed wheels and selected one, the toothed wheel, to use moving forward. We experimented with the distance between the wheels and the pulleys we used with our belts.",It was difficult to determine which wheel performed the best. It was also hard to determine how much distance should be between the wheels in order to successfully move rings.,We need to finish assembling the mec and attach another row of wheel in addition to more belts of wheel to bring the rings further up the ramp transporting them to the launch mech. We will construct the ramp later.,"Hannah, Alyssa",
10/17/2020,Launch mech adjustments,"Strategized, adjusted CAD of prototype, tested different motors, and launch angles,","We checked in with the intake group and wobble goal group to decide placement of launcher, decided on stationary launcher. Tested motors and found Rev-41-1291 best. Made base of launcher larger for stability, Discussed possibility of ""staircase launcher."" Tested launching and found success with middle, high, and power shots.","Test out ""staircase"" launcher/incline at end. Add spacers to wheel in launcher, work on connection between intake and launcher","Jolie, Annie, Amelia, Maya, Abby G",
10/17/2020,Wobble Goal prototype,"We brainstormed different prototypes for picking up the wobble goal and placing them outside the playing field. We essentially came up with two ideas, one V-shaped prototype and another circular clamp.","After CADing the circular clamp prototype, we tested in on the wobble goal and realized it would need a lot of driver precision. To solve this problem, I think we will try prototyping the V-shaped prototype since it doesn't require as much driver precision.",CAD and laser cut V-shaped prototype and test out.,"Jolie, Annie, Amelia, Maya, Abby G",
10/24/2020,Build horizontal intake mech,"Continuing on from what we were working on last week, we cut some properly-size axles for our wheels. We then added an extra column of wheels, so in total, we have two. Finally, we added a motor onto our mech and tested it out with a ring;  it was a success! 
","We had some trouble figuring out how to make sure the wheels were level and lined up properly. There was also some difficulty determining how much space would be between the wheels and the ground in order for the mech to quickly pick up the rings. 
","Next time, we are going to work on mounting our mech onto a ramp. We will test out different ramp angles and distances between the ramp and wheels. ","Alyssa, Hannah",
10/24/2020,Launch Mech,"We tested out two possibilities for launchingâ€“ a system where the entire launcher is angled and we adjust the intake ramp, and another system where the launcher is horizontal and we adjust the launch ramp angle.
",One of the challenges is that finding the correct angle to adjust the launch ramp to is a bit tricky and so will be actually attaching the ramp. We had to reassemble the wheel axle and spacers. ,"Next time we are going to work on attaching a motor (washers are needed between the plates on the motor), building and attaching a ramp (which will be a minor adjustment to the board we have currently), and finding a way to secure/keep the ramp upright. ","Annie, Ellie, Jolie, Abby G",
10/24/2020,goBILDA chassis,"I finished assembling the wheels onto the goBILDA chassis.
",Sometimes the shaft collar was not in the most prominent location for builders to tighten screws on it to attach wheels to the rest of the chassis. We just took out the screws and realigned the shaft collar. ,The goBILDA chassis is now ready for coders to use!,Amelia,
10/24/2020,Launch mech prototype,I worked on assembling the second prototype of our ring-launching mechanism.,"
",We need to find a sturdy yet compact way of mounting the launch mechanism 2.,Jordyn,
10/31/2020,Wobble goal mech,I laser-printed a prototype of our wobble goal lifting mechanism and colored it.,I think our next prototype should be cut from acrylic because I think this particular wood is too flimsy for the weight of the wobble goal.,,Jordyn,
10/31/2020,Launch mech,I assembled and attached a system to keep the launching mech on the robot and to keep the ramp on. We tested multiple ramp lengths and determined that the ramps I labeled 1 and 3 are the best lengths; 2 is too short (not consistent enough) and 4 is too long (sacrifices too much speed).,"One of the challenges is keeping testing consistent; we need to make sure that the mech doesn't shake at all during launching and that it is firmly attached to whatever we're testing it from. The other challenge is that we realized the rubber part of the wheel expanded due to the centrifugal force of the rotation, thus causing some burning due to friction.","We will need to reassemble the main mechanism at some point-- we need a new spacer on the axle (to prevent the burning) and we need to make sure that the smooth sides are facing in. Furthermore, at some point we will likely need to use loctite on the nuts in the launch mech brace given how much the motor is currently vibrating.",Annie,
11/7/2020,CAD,We started a motor mount for the launch mech.,,"Add the piece for attaching to the wood, then print it out and test.",Maya,
11/7/2020,Launch Mech,"Today we considered small redesigns to our current mech. The half circle launcher did not work well with the intake in terms of spacing on the robot and the logistics. We began by brainstorming different ways we could utilize the half circle considering doing vertical launching, but finally landing on cutting it into a quarter circle.",We have to see if the quarter circle with less time/space for acceleration will still produce the same launching effect and projectile motion. We attempted test launching with a previous prototype by cutting it into a quarter circle and realized it still works.,"Laser cut the new quarter circles, assemble, and continue to test to make sure that this alteration to our old mech is what we want to use.","Karina, Annie, Amelia, Ellie, Jolie",
11/7/2020,Launch mech,I printed and assembled our new quarter-circle shaped launch mech. I also disassembled one of our previous prototypes for parts.,"When this new mech is on the robot, it creates some interesting angles with our intake mech.","We are waiting for the new wheel for this mech to arrive next week, so at the next meeting we can likely finish assembling and test this prototype.",Jordyn,
11/14/2020 (morning),Launch mech,We switched to our new Andy Mark Compliant wheels for the launch mech and worked on implementing the motor mount. Both required some adjustments to clear the way for the spinning of the wheel.,The motor mount didn't fit the heads of the M3 screws. Today we used a dremel to make room.,We should print out the adjusted motor mount.,Maya,
11/14/2020,Intake,"We tested intake, brainstormed, and prototyped the additions to intake we're going to need to make. The issue was that the current intake works perfectly once it's in contact with a ring, but that in order to get a ring into it, there is a significant amount of force necessary. We decided to try using the small AndyMark wheels rotating on a vertical axle as our first stage for intake.",One of the challenges was that we didnâ€™t have enough motor switches to test multiple motors (because they had to move in opposite directions) so we had to make new wires to connect the power switches to the power poles once we tested the intake ramp with the new horizontally spinning intake.,"The next steps include finalizing the vertical axle setup (adding a second point of contact and replacing them with shorter axles) and then attaching them to the current intake ramp and the robot. One big picture issue is that we may want to design and laser cut a new piece that is both the bottom layer of the launcher and the intake ramp (with the slits cut to make the connection bendy) instead of having two separate pieces. We could also switch the first set of red wheels on intake into new green squishy wheels. It helps us lower the number of motors we use on the robot, allowing for more motors when we make the wobble goal mech.","Alyssa, Hannah, Amelia, Annie",
11/21/2020 (morning),Intake,We tested the intake mech with the ramp at varying heights. We decided to reassemble the mech with only AndyMark wheels.,"One of our challenges when testing the mech, was that the lack of distance between the wheels and the ramp was too small, causing the motor to begin overheating from the extra effort needed to spin the wheels. This led to us switching the AndyMark wheels which are squishy and better for the set up we were using.","When testing, we noticed the rings tended to be pushed to the sides of the mech and sometimes off of it completely. We want to add side pieces to make sure the ring stays aligned. We also want to add banding on the top and bottom of the intake mech. After this, we would like to test more angles with the ramp.","Alyssa, Hannah, Amelia, Jolie",
11/21/2020 (afternoon),Intake,"We widened the intake mech to properly center the wheels, and did 
some brief testing to find the angle at which we should mount the
intake.",,"Next, we should find some possible mounting angles, 
so we can work towards mounting the mechanism 
to the robot. We also think a good next step would 
be to file down the end of the base of the intake to 
make it more level to the floor, creating less of a 
hurdle for the disc to overcome while we bring it 
into the robot.","Jordyn, Maya",
12/5/2020 (morning),Intake,"We cut a new temporary ramp out of scrap wood. We then tested different angles of intake, and found that the best height for the ramp was between 20 and 25 cm, meaning that the angle range would be 30.85 to 39.87 degrees. After that, we ran some timed trials to see how fast each angle/height took in a ring and concluded that heights closer to 20 cm were more efficient.","The ramp was not very level with the ground, causing the wheels to get caught on the edge. We sawed it down to solve this isssue. The distance between the wheel and the ramp was too big for the wheels to properly transport the rings. We decided to move the wheels and ramp closer together. The ramp was also sliding when we attempted to use the mech, so we hot glued it to the sides of the mech to keep it in place.",We would like to add banding on the top and bottom of the intake mech. We would also like use the new ramp that is connected to the launch mech and work toward mounting the mechanism to the robot.,"Hannah, Alyssa, Jolie",
12/5/2020 (morning),Launcher + intake ramp,We adjusted the CAD design for the intake and  launcher ramp. ,"The lines at the bend section did not overlap with each other which
caused the ramp to break when we tried to bend it. We just adjusted the design so that the lines overlapped which solved the issue.","We would like to assemble the ramp to intake and 
assemble the launcher as well.  We would also like to add something that guides the rings in the right position as it is taken onto the ramp.","Ellie, Maya, Amelia",
12/5/2020 (morning),Launcher,"Today was mostly assembling a ""brace"" for the body of the launcher mechanism such that we will be able to attach it to the intake mech.",The original prototype was missing so that we had to remake it. We were able to quickly reassemble the mech.,"The afternoon members can, after assembling the 
ramp piece to the intake and launcher mech, put it 
into the brace that we made and tighten the brace.",Annie,
12/5/2020 (afternoon),Launcher + intake ramp,"After laser-cutting and drilling holes for our latest prototype, we found that the newest version of the launcher has a great enough decrease in radius that we knew it was going to cause issues. Another team member then worked on making a new CAD model with the original radius, but still with our other most recent updates.",,We should laser cut and assemble the next model and test it.,Jordyn,
12/5/2020 (afternoon),Intake mech,"I used the saw for the first time today and cut a piece that would just secure the sides of the intake mech. I then attached the whole mech (the wheels and the board) to the chassis on the right side with L pieces, one with a spacer to avoid other screws. For one of them, there was a problem with spacing because it was impossible to get either a nut or a screw on the inside of the U piece of the chassis because of the wheel battery, so I was taught how to make my own holes with a drill so that there was no need for a nut, it would just screw into the chassis. ",The holes would not line up or I had trouble figuring it out. I would also often screw something in just to realize that I should have done it another way and then redo it.,Secure the front left side of the intake mech with an L or an U piece.,Karina,
12/12/2020 (afternoon),Intake mech,"The first issue that we ran into was that the way the screws that were holding the intake mech at an angle were not spaced properly on either side, so it caused the axels on the mech to be not parallel. We fixed this by using a longer screw as a spacer. After adjusting back and forth between angles (we finally decided on a 40-degree angle), we found that 1, the ramp insert was too long, and 2, the middle row of wheels on the mech did not cover enough surface area to properly ""catch"" the wheel. We solved the first issue by cutting the ramp and found that for the second issue, the rings will push each other upwards so it's not THAT big of an issue but it should still be fixed.","One thing we (as a team) noticed about the CADed launching mech platform is that when we slid the intake mech part into the mech itself, the rest of the CADed piece went over the other side of the robot, making it too long. There was also trouble with the intake of the rings itself, but we do not know how the change in angle effected that aspect.","Change the CADed piece so that it is shorter in the intake part and the bendy part so it does not go over the 18""",Karina,
1/23/2021 (morning),Intake mech,We adjusted the angle and placement of the mounted intake mech. We also cut down the ramp to account for the maximum size of the robot.,"The first issue that we ran into was that the way the screws that were holding the intake mech at an angle were not spaced properly on either side, so it caused the axels on the mech to be not parallel. We fixed this by using a longer screw as a spacer. After adjusting back and forth between angles (we finally decided on a 40-degree angle), we found that 1) the ramp insert was too long, and 2) the middle row of wheels on the mech did not cover enough surface area to properly ""catch"" the wheel. We solved the first issue by cutting the ramp and found that for the second issue, the rings will push each other upwards so it's not THAT big of an issue but it should still be fixed.",Secure the ramp of the intake mech. Attatch the remainer of the launch mech. Adjust the middle row of wheels.,"Alyssa, Hannah, Ellie","The intake and launching mech are too long and do not fit with in the 18 inch limits, so there probably needs to be some adjustments to the design. This is something to fix after the scrimmage."
1/23/2021 (morning),Inspection and Score Sheet,Today we gathered all the markers and team signs needed for next weeks scrimage. We then went through the inspection sheets and checked our robot. The last thing we did was create a score sheet where we could keep track of how many points and goals scored during a scrimmage and who we were up againest.,We had a bit of trouble finding the exact measurements for the power button and how to organize the score sheet in a clear and simple way.,,"Abby G, Annie",
1/23/2021 (afternoon),Robot assembly,"This afternoon, we assembled the robot by attaching the new rev and control hubs, battery, the launch mechanism, and camera. ","We had some issues attaching the control hub, but we worked through them. ",,"Abby B,  Annie",
